This directory contains the codes and data used for re-processing the PPTA dr2 data using a single wide-bandwidth template.
The pipeline requires an installation of MeerGuard and PulsePortraiture, as well as psrchive and tempo2.

The pipeline can be launched on the OzStar supercomputer, with one job per pulsar listed in psrnames.txt, using launch_all.sh


# Scripts
set_variables.sh	- Sets the paths and environment variables required for the pipeline 
launch_all.sh		- Launches one Slurm batch job per pulsar listed in psrnames.txt
reduce_dr2.sh		-
time_dr2.sh		-
add_flags.py		-
wb_template.py		-

# Auxilliary files
psr_dms.txt 		- DM values for each pulsar that will be installed on
psrnames.txt 		- 

# Directories
dr2_tims 		- .tim files for the dr2 dataset. From Reardon et al. (2021) for all pulsars except J0437, which is from Kerr et al. (2020)
jobs 			- Slurm job launch scripts and outputs
pars 			- 
			- Also contains make_folding.sh, which was used to modify the Reardon et al. (2021) .par files by removing noise and profile evolution parameters and adding the DMs in psr_dms.txt  
uwl_tims 		- 
wb_models 		- spline model files made with PulsePortraiture for each pulsar (Invariant interval for J0437)
dr3			- .par .tim and noise analyses for dr3 dataset
